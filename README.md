**University at Buffalo Honors College\**
**B.S. Computer Science**

I’m a software developer passionate about building smart, practical solutions — from machine learning–powered anomaly detection platforms to real-time stock tracking applications. Skilled in Java, Python, React, and SQL, I enjoy tackling complex problems, optimizing performance, and designing systems that make an impact. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me gaming, exploring new hiking trails, or experimenting with new tech ideas. I’m currently working on projects that blend backend engineering with data intelligence, and I’m seeking Summer 2026 internships in Cybersecurity or Software Engineering where I can apply my skills, learn from industry leaders, and solve challenging problems.
