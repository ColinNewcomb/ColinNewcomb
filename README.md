# âœ¨ Colin Newcomb

**'University at Buffalo Honors College'**
**'B.S. Computer Science'**

Iâ€™m a software developer passionate about building smart, practical solutions â€” from machine learningâ€“powered anomaly detection platforms to real-time stock tracking applications. Skilled in Java, Python, React, and SQL, I enjoy tackling complex problems, optimizing performance, and designing systems that make an impact. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me gaming, exploring new hiking trails, or experimenting with new tech ideas. Iâ€™m currently working on projects that blend backend engineering with data intelligence, and Iâ€™m seeking Summer 2026 internships in Cybersecurity or Software Engineering where I can apply my skills, learn from industry leaders, and solve challenging problems.
